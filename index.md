# Hi, I'm LuHao

**Condensed-matter physicist working on phase transitions in functional oxides**  

Research focus: VO₂ and correlated oxides, thin films, metal–insulator transitions, structure–property relations

## 🔹 News

- **[Jan 2026]** My thesis, **“Strain Engineering and Buffer Layer Design in VO₂ Thin Film Structures: From Phase Transition Mechanisms to Smart Window Applications”**, has been successfully defended. 🎓

  I would like to thank my supervisors **Prof. Peter J. Klar**, as well as the examination committee **Prof. Yunbin He**, **Prof. Christian Heiliger** and **Prof. Matthias Elm**, for their guidance, critical discussions, and fair evaluation. 

  I am grateful to my colleagues for the collaborative and stimulating research environment over the past years.

  This closes an important chapter. I am now exploring postdoctoral and industry opportunities where solid-state physics, spectroscopy, and data-driven analysis meet real-world applications.
